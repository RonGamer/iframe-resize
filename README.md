# iframe-resize
A Javascript code that will resize iframe window proportionally.

## Usage: 

Create a div with id="iframe_game".

Action: The script will resize the iframe according to the window size.

Since mobile browsers became more and more common (exceeding 50% of traffic), it's important to resize games provided with iframe according to screen size.
It was first implement for websites like <a href="http://www.casin.com/">Casin.com</a> for classic slot machine games like <a href="http://www.casin.com/roulette-royale.html">Roulette Royale</a>.

## Note
The script was replaced by a more simple CSS solution - check it [here](https://github.com/RonGamer/responsive-embed).
